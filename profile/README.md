## WebOS

In the early 2010s, I purchased a Palm Pre, and got involved in the homebrew community surrounding the webOS platform powering it.

Said platform would end up sold to HP in the course of Palm's demise, and - in conjunction with HP's Open webOS initiative - spawned the webOS Ports team:
A tight-knit group of enthusiasts from various walks of tech, focused on keeping webOS alive and viable on third-party phones and tablets.

This GitHub organization archives my part of the endeavour, during which I held the (somewhat lofty) title of User Interface Architect.
